"""add ON DELETE CASCADE to all child foreign keys

Revision ID: 0003
Revises: 0002
Create Date: 2026-06-11

The initial schema created every foreign key with the default NO ACTION.
That made two user-facing flows return HTTP 500:

  * DELETE /sessions/{id} — every chatted session has an auto-titled row in
    `conversations` referencing it; the ORM only cascaded `messages`, so the
    delete hit an FK violation on `conversations.session_id`.
  * DELETE /avatars/{id} — any avatar that had ever been used in a session
    hit an FK violation on `sessions.avatar_id`.

The ORM relationships now declare delete-orphan cascades (which fixes the
SQLite test path too); this migration aligns the database so direct SQL or
out-of-band deletes behave identically.
